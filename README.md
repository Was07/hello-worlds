# Hello-Worlds
Hello World program written in different languages.

Go to the [stats page](https://was07.github.io/hello-worlds/) and see how many and which languages we have right now (live data).

## Contribute
Make a pull request with the Hello World program in a language we don't have!

- Make sure we don't have the language you want to add.
- Under the `programs` directory, add a `LanguageName.extension` file with the Hello World code.

## Aim
The original aim was to collect Hello World programs *as much as possible*. but after realizing that it's not a very practical plan, the temporary goal is to collect more than 60 of them.
